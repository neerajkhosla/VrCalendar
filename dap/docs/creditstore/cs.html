If you have purchased the <a href="http://www.digitalaccesspass.com/blog/2013/12/credit-store-launch/">Credit Store Plugin</a> from us and are looking to set up the product as a credit store master or child, then select the CS master or CS child option in the dropdown. Otherwise (if it's a not a credit store product), you can go with the default setting/option and set it to 'Regular DAP Product'.
