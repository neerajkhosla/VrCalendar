<p>If your file has been uploaded directly under the main bucket (that you configured in the plugin's settings), then just enter <strong>JUST the file name here</strong>.</p>
<p>File name may NOT contain spaces, special characters, etc. Hyphens are ok. Like my-facebook-secrets.mp4</p>
<p>Eg: <strong>facebooksecrets.mp4</strong></p>
<p>If you have  created a sub-folder within your main bucket, then enter <strong>sub-foldername/filename</strong></p>
<p>Eg: <strong>videos/facebooksecrets.mp4</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
WRONG</strong>: </p>
<p>You should NOT enter an entire URL - like http://yourbucket.s3.amazonaws.com/yourfilename.pdf</p>
<p><strong>RIGHT</strong>: </p>
<p>Enter just the file name - <strong>yourfilename.pdf</strong> or <strong>your-file-name.mp4</strong></p>
