<p>If you want your video to be of an exact specific size no matter the device it is being viewed on, then set this to &quot;Yes&quot; (default).</p>
<p>If you want your video to take on a standard size that fills up the section where you have placed your video, AND you want the video to resize based on the device on which it is being viewed, then uncheck this. Video will then resize on smaller devices, and grow bigger on larger desktop screens.</p>
