<p>Buffering means loading the video ahead of time, so that there is no lag when the video actually starts playing.</p>
<p>If you set this to &quot;Yes&quot;, then as soon as the page loads, the video will start buffering ahead (buffering not the same as playing).</p>
<p>If you uncheck this, then video will start buffer ahead only after viewer clicks the play button.</p>
