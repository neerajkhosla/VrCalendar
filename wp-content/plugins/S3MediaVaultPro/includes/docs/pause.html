<p>If you set this to &quot;Yes&quot;, then at exactly &quot;Cuepoint&quot; seconds, the video will pause, and the video controls will get disabled. </p>
<p>The visual of the video will be whatever it was when the video was paused.</p>
<p>Viewer will not be able to resume the video again once it stops. They can however refresh the page, but the video will once again stop at exact same point in time. So there's no way for viewer to view the video further after it pauses.</p>
